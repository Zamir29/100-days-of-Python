[![Open Project Folder](https://img.shields.io/badge/📁%20Day%2041-Open%20Folder-blue)](../day_41/main.py)  

| **Scope** | **Description** |
|:---------:|:----------------|
|   Goal    | Understand basic HTML structure and build a simple personal webpage following Angela's lesson.          |
|   Steps   | Generate day_41, create index.html, follow Angela to add headings/text/links, then open the page in the browser to verify it works.         |
|   Stack   | VS Code, HTML, web browser (Python only for the generator script).         |

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- Refreshed the absolute basics of HTML structure (doctype, html/head/body).
- Reviewed semantic elements like headings, paragraphs, void elements (`<hr />`).
- Reinforced the idea that HTML is purely structural and intentionally minimal at this stage.
- Practiced writing a small, clean static page following a consistent hierarchy.
- Understood VS Code workflow for editing and previewing HTML without relying on PyCharm.


## ⚠️ Challenges
- No technical difficulty — the lesson was intentionally simple compared to the heavy API/code days before.
- Adjusting mentally from PyCharm’s Python-only workflow to VS Code’s multi-language environment.
- Minor friction understanding how Prettier formats HTML differently from Angela’s teaching style.
- Git identity confusion after seeing `Zamir29` still appear in GitLens.


## ✅ Solutions / Insights
- Accepted that today’s simplicity is part of Angela’s progression toward Flask and backend ↔ frontend integration.
- Learned how VS Code handles formatting (Prettier) and why indentation is structural, not semantic.
- Clarified the difference between `git user.name`, `user.email`, and GitHub username (`hashorva`) — understanding that email, not name, determines commit ownership.
- Set up a clean VS Code workflow, including GitLens and icons, making the environment more enjoyable and productive.

```

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Continue Angela’s HTML/CSS days with VS Code to build comfort before Flask templates arrive.
- Practice keyboard-only navigation in VS Code to build speed and reduce mouse usage.
- Keep using GitLens + no-ff merges to clearly document daily progression.
- Optional: explore semantic grouping (`<main>`, `<section>`) as pages become more complex — not required now.
